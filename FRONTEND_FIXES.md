# Frontend Fixes Documentation

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing package.json**
   - Created a comprehensive package.json file with all necessary dependencies
   - Fixed dependency version conflicts (monaco-editor and react-monaco-editor)
   - Added proper scripts for development, building, and testing
   - Configured proxy to point to backend server on port 8080

2. **Incomplete Directory Structure**
   - Created essential directories:
     - `/public` - For static assets
     - `/src/assets` - For application assets
   - Added required configuration files:
     - `.gitignore` - To exclude unnecessary files from version control

3. **Missing Core React Files**
   - Created essential React application files:
     - `index.html` - Main HTML template
     - `index.js` - Application entry point
     - `index.css` - Global styles
     - `manifest.json` - Progressive Web App configuration
     - `robots.txt` - Search engine configuration
     - `reportWebVitals.js` - Performance monitoring
     - `setupTests.js` - Testing configuration

## Dependencies Added

The following dependencies were added to the package.json file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@emotion/react": "^11.10.6",
  "@emotion/styled": "^11.10.6",
  "@mui/icons-material": "^5.11.16",
  "@mui/material": "^5.12.0",
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  "react-monaco-editor": "^0.52.0",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.10.0",
  "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
  "react-syntax-highlighter": "^15.5.0",
  "monaco-editor": "^0.36.1",
  "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
}
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build for Production**
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Verification

The frontend structure has been verified by:
- Successfully running `npm install --dry-run` without errors
- Creating all necessary files for a complete React application
- Ensuring proper dependency versions to avoid conflicts
- Pushing all changes to the GitHub repository

The frontend is now properly structured and ready for development and building. The application should connect to the backend server running on port 8080 as configured in the proxy setting.
