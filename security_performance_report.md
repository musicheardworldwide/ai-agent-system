## Recommendations
Based on the test results, here are recommendations for improving the system:

1. Implement proper authentication and authorization for sensitive endpoints
2. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Optimize database queries for better performance under load
4. Implement content security policy (CSP) headers
5. Add CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
6. Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data
